```
```

```
### 2. Setup the server
```bash
cd backend

```
### Create a .env file and include:
``` bash
.env

## Running Both Backend and Frontend Concurrently

To run both the backend and frontend simultaneously:

1. Make sure you're in the root directory of the project (where `package.json` is located).

2. If you haven't already, install `concurrently`:
   ```bash
   npm install -g concurrently
   ```

3. Add a `package.json` script to run both servers:
   * In the **root directory** (where you have both `backend` and `frontend` folders), open the `package.json` file.
   * Add the following under `"scripts"`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix backend\" \"npm start --prefix frontend\""
     }
     ```

4. Now, you can run both the frontend and backend servers with a single command:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start both the frontend and backend concurrently.
